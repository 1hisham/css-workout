                <h2>It's me Mario..</h2>
                <p>Plumber brothers Mario and Luigi from Brooklyn have just arrived in an outlandish realm called the Mushroom Kingdom. It was ruled by Princess Toadstool and her faithful Mushroom people. But one day, evil cast a shadow over the land and the evil King Bowser Koopa emerged with his army of Goombas, Spinies, Flying Koopas, and other malignant creatures. King Koopa abducted Princess Toadstool and trapped her faithful Mushroom People in seven of his castles. So Mario and Luigi must intrepid deep and hazardous waters, jump from tree to tree (don't look down!), and visually examine their steps in the dark evil castles filled with fire balls and lava pits and must utilize their magic powers to subjugate the evil King Koopa and rescue the Princess.</p>
